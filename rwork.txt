R is a powerful language used widely for data analysis and statistical computing. It was developed in early 90s. 
Since then, endless efforts have been made to improve R’s user interface.
Inclusion of powerful packages in R has made it more and more powerful with time. 
Packages such as dplyr, tidyr, readr, data.table, SparkR, ggplot2 have made data manipulation, visualization and computation much faster in R.
But, what about Machine Learning ?
R has enough provisions to implement machine learning algorithms in a fast and simple manner.
By the end of this Recess, one will have a good exposure to building predictive models using machine learning on own.
